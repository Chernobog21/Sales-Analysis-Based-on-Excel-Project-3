# Sales Analysis Using Excel-Based Dataset (Project 3)

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis of sales data stored in an Excel-based dataset.
The analysis included the following steps:
- Data cleaning
- Checking data completeness and presence of duplicates
- Correlation analysis
- Sales analysis by month
- Sales analysis by category
- Sales analysis by day of the week
- Sales analysis by country
- Visualization of all metrics

The following tools were used in working on this project:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Excel
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Slides

An artificially generated dataset was used, but the data was created as close as possible to the real business.

The main goal of this project was to try working with another, more popular data type in the form of Excel tables, as well as to create a more professional report in PDF format.
Despite the artificially generated dataset, the analysis was complete and close to real business conditions.
